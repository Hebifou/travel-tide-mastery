# TravelTide ‚Äì Customer Segmentation & Perk Strategy (Public Version)

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end customer segmentation analysis** using **PCA** and **HDBSCAN**, followed by a simulated **perk recommendation strategy**.  
It is based on a dataset from the TravelTide Mastery Project (Masterschool) and has been adapted for public viewing ‚Äî all results are reproducible from a sample CSV.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Segment users into behavioral groups and simulate perk strategies based on booking patterns.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction  
  - HDBSCAN clustering for user segmentation  
  - Visualization of customer behavior and perk performance  
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
